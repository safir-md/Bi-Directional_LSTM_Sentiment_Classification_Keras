# Sentiment_Classification_on_Keras-IMDB-Dataset_using_Bi-Directional_LSTM

## Project Details:
This is a voluntary project, actually, it is one of my first Machine Learning projects. I have created a Machine Learning -> Deep Neural Network -> Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model for Sentiment Analysis on IMDB dataset, provided by Keras.

## Project Team Members: 
SaÔ¨År Mohammad Shaikh

## Technologies Used:
* Language: Python

## How to Run?
1. Clone the Repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Safir-Mohammad-Mustak-Shaikh/Bi-Directional_LSTM_Sentiment_Classification_Keras.git
```
2. Run Bi_Directional_LSTM.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
